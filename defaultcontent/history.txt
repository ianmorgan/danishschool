Prepared by Jytte Ranjel 25 May 2005 
I am fortunate enough to have been part of the Danish School since its inception in 1997. It has been a most interesting and exciting journey. So much has happened since the early days, especially since a formal school committee was established in 2004.
 
I feel it would be of value for future generations to have an idea about some of the major events that have shaped the school's history. The following information is pieced together from old newsletters, diaries and my fading memory. If you feel some important items have been forgotten or there are mistakes in this account of events please let me know and I will correct them it.
 
LET THE STORY BEGIN...  
On 23 February 1997 the Danish School in Melbourne was established at the Swedish Church in Toorak. 
The initial suggestion came from Jytte Ranjel, who after residing in Sweden for three years, had enrolled her children in the Swedish School. When mentioning it to the Danish parents, talks developed about doing a similar thing in Danish. 

The first small steps to starting a school involved a group of interested parents who were already meeting up on the last Sunday of the month, for a family day. The family day was organised by the Danish Australian Cultural Society (DACS). Some of the first parents involved in the school were: Jette Jensen, Lene Jacobsen, Dorte Henriksen, Karin Schack, Merete Smith, Henrik Hansen and Jytte Ranjel.
 
The first teacher was Vibeke Sybrandt, a most capable woman with plenty of experience especially within drama and music, something she ably incorporated in her innovative and popular teaching. Vibeke was full of great ideas and ran the school on her own, without much parent involvement. Once in a while she would call a meeting to suggest changes to routines, times, classes etc. 

The school used the facilities of the Swedish Church and from the onset it was a social opportunity for parents as well as students. Parents tended to stay, have a cuppa, and enjoy each other’s company in the beautiful garden while the lessons were in progress, something that continues to this day.
 
In its first year of running the school had about 20 students ranging in age from 6 to 14. The students were taught together for 2 hours, on the last Sunday of the month between 2pm and 4pm. But it soon became apparent that the differences in needs and capabilities were too great for this kind of set up. As the word started getting around in the Danish community, we also experienced a steady increase in number of students.
 
By the start of 1998 there were 27 students enrolled. A parent meeting was held and it was decided to create 2 classes based on age. The two classes would run consecutively, each for 1.5 hours with Vibeke in charge of both classes. By April 1998 this was up and running successfully. 

p[de]. In October 2000 the school held its first Family Weekend Camp at Camp Iluka near Shoreham on the Bellarine Peninsula. This proved to be a very successful camp, with lots of games and activities for young and old. The organising committee consisting of Debbie Hansen and Jytte Ranjel who made sure that great food in the best Danish tradition was available. The theme for the weekend was "Mini Olympics" some of the activities included: Torch relay, Gum boot shrow, baton relay, long jump, pen in bottle, spoon and egg race, etc. We also had a treasure hunt, made snobrød on the bonfire, rowing and musical games. The students also did a fantastic performance prepared by Vibeke.
 
This camp has since become a yearly much looked forward to event, enjoyed by teachers, students and parents alike. 
Vibeke continued as a teacher with the Danish School until mid 2001 when due to increased work commitment, and travel she had to stop. We were fortunate enough to get in contact with Susanne Fasken who took over the responsibility.
 
By the end of 2002 it was clear that we needed one more teacher. Parents were keen for the students to get at least 2 hours of education, yet many had students in both classes, which would mean a 4 hour stay at the premises. 
In 2003 it was tried having all students together again but this time for 3 hours as many parents were keen for more hours. However by the end of the year it proved not to be as successful as hoped, and with 20 students we started searching for another option.
 
It was decided to try and secure an additional teacher to be able to run two classes simultaneously. We were fortunate enough to get in touch with Gitte Thomsen, another qualified Danish teacher, before the start of the school year. We could now split up the students again into two classes based on age and the two classes were run simultaneously from 2-4 pm - much better for all.
 
In January 2004 Jytte Ranjel suggested a formal School Committee be established to improve the status and opportunities available, separating the schooling and the administration. This notion was well supported and the first committee was elected with Susanne Barnden as President, Jytte Ranjel as Vice President, Marianne Fontaine as Treasurer and Secretary. Further supported by Annette Matys, Rina Bjarnason & Charlotte Frimodt as committee members. 

The next task was to endeavour on the long road to incorporation. This was necessary in order for the school to be recognised and eligible for possible funding, a task the President Susanne Barnden ensured came to fruition. The school obtained an ABN number and applied for income tax exemption. Other issues addressed by the new committee included: Educational content & materials, teachers employment conditions, parent involvement, tax exemption, funding, promotional material etc.etc. Meetings were held with the Ethnic Schools Ass. And Foreign Community Languages. Sponsors secured were: DACS and the Danish Club in Melbourne. 
Brochures were produced and distributed within the Danish community and parents were present providing display and information about the school at various community events. These displays were very well received and attended, providing much needed information about the school to the great number of people who were unaware of the school's existence. 

2004 was also the year a school logo (Red Australia with the white cross symbolizing the Danish connection circled by our name) was created. The school's name was officially changed and registered to: DANISH SCHOOL DOWN UNDER, MELBOURNE. 

By January 2005 we had 37 students enrolled, an increase from the previous year of more than 30%. The school was now so well organised that we had a 12 page newsletter ready for parents before the start of the school year. By March we had a website up and running thanks to Daniel Ranjel, one of our former (first) students. 
Both teachers from 2004, Susanne Fasken and Gitte Thomsen, were going back to Denmark in 2005 and the school were therefore looking for two new teachers. Dorte Pedersen was engaged, teaching the younger grade with 25 students enrolled, well assisted by a team of 3 to 4 parents and committee members every time. The students were divided into 3 ability groups: Red (no Danish), Yellow and Green.
 
The older group was also divided into yellow and green groups for appropriate level teaching. The older group was taught by committee members for the first 3 months of the year while a search was conducted high and low for a suitable teacher. By April Sandra Bjerregard Petersen had come to our rescue and taught the older grade for a couple of months until she also had to leave for Denmark. 

As a new incentive, Danish children's videos were played after each class a Danish children's video were available for students to enjoy if they so wished. 

In 2006, the increase in numbers continued to 37 students. With 3 teachers this year, Dorthe Hansen, Birgitte Crowley og Lene Knudsen. Dorthe looked after the older class (up to 15 years of age). And the rest of the students were split between Birgitte and Lene. 

2006 was also the year where the Danish Church in Sydney started up a Danish Community School, drawing on The Danish School Down Under Melbournes experience and knowledge. The educational service we provide continue to improve year by year. This year we were fortunate to receive donations from a number of Danish book companies. Providing us with quality educational materials. 

2007 saw another rise in numbers to 41 students. The new students every year, is mainly in the younger grade. The children that come in are at all different levels, with some speaking Danish fluently, and others (most) having limited or no Danish at all.

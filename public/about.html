<h2>What the site does</h2>
<p>
This site provides the same basic content as the old site. But this content is now stored within a database which can be
maintained by authorised users through a simple set of admin screens. This includes
<ul>
  <li>Adding and changing details for teachers and committee members</li>
  <li>Creating news items</li>
  <li>Creating new events (such as lessons) in the calendar</li>
  <li>Uploading new files and images</li>
  <li>Altering site content, e.g changing the home page</li>
  <li>Adding lesson notes, handouts etc</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
Feel free to play around. You can logon with a test account of admin@danishschool.com with a
password of "password". Just beware that I will occasionally rebuild the database with default content
and hence any changes made will be discarded.
</p>

<h2>Technical Bits</h2>
<p>
For those who are interested, this site has been developed using
<a href="http://rubyonrails.org">Ruby on Rails</a>.
Briefly, this is a framework that makes it easier to write web sites.
It is used by a number of larger companies, including
Lonely Planet and www.domain.com.au.
And appropriately, it's developed by a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Heinemeier_Hansson">Dane</a>
</p>

<p>
The demo site is deployed to a <a href="http://www.railsplayground.com">Commercial web host</a>
I've been using for a year or so and it's been reliable with good support. It is a basic developer account intended for use by indidividuals
or small groups. This should be more thann sufficent for his web site given the small user base.
Cost in US$5 per month (provided you pay for a full year up front).

<h2>How to get this up and running at <a href="http://www.danishschooldownunder.org.au">www.danishschooldownunder.org.au</a></h2>
<p>
I can setup the necessay accounts and so on, but I need details on account names, email address etc.
I can put it all in my name if you wish. The steps would be as follows:
<ol>
 <li>Setup an account with one of the free software repositries on the web to hold the source code</li>
 <li>Setup a new web hosting account. The most basic account at $US60 (per year) should be sufficent. I'm happy to pay
  upfront and claim back later.</li>
 <li>I'll then deploy the site. It will initially be on a temporary domain name. Whoever is nominated
 from the Danish School to be site admin should go through and complete the content. This is also the right
 time to fix any bugs and for me to provide any assistance that may be required.</li>
 <li>Once content is ready, arrange to transfer the existing domain name. This will require the site admin for the
 current site to releaase the domain name from the host and then reassign it the new web host. Once this
 is done I can complete the setup. <i>Note there may be a few days while the site is unavailable</i>.</li>
</ol>
</p>


<h2>Ongoing support</h2>
<p>
I don't see too much need for ongoing support. I am more than happy to make any code changes required, though of course
it may take me few days. It is wise to check the state of server very occasional (a few times a year). I can also do this.
